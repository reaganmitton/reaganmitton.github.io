      <h1>We are 327 Lobotomists</h1>
      <!--Info Below-->
      <p>Hello! We are the Lobotomists, a student-led all girls First Tech Challenge team based in Hartville, South Carolina! We are also a part of the South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics robotics, which has five sister teams.</p>
      <p>We believe that there’s not a lack of women interested in STEM, there’s simply a lack of support. As an all-female team, we strive to create an engaging and positive learning environment where women with various experience levels and backgrounds can come together and grow. We want to empower women and give them a voice in robotics.</p>
